# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

### Lists
Lists are created using square brackets:
```
list = []
```
Lists are ordered which means that the elements it contains have a defined order and that order will not change. When you add a new element it will be placed at the and of the list. <br>
Lists are mutable, we can change, add or remove list's elements.
A list can contain duplicate values. Elements can be of any data type.

### Tuples
Creating a tuple:
```
tuple = (1, 2, 3)
```
Same as lists tuples are also ordered. Tuples are immutable which means we can not change, add or remove elements after the tuple has been created. Tuples also allow duplicate values. Elements can be of any data type.
