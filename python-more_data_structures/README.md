# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

### Set
Creating a set:
```
set = {"home", "school"}
```
Sets are unordered, which means everytime you use them set items can appear in a different order, and can't be referred to by key or index. Sets are immutable, you cannot change, add or remove items after the set is created. Sets cannot have two items with the same value. Items can be of any data type.

### Dictionary
Creating a dictionary:
```
dict = {"name": "Abc", "age": 30}
```
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs. They are ordered, which means items have defined order and that order won't change. Dictionaries are mutable, we can change, add or remove items after dictionary is created. Dictionares can not have 2 items with the same key, duplicate values will overwrite existing values. The values in a dictionary can be of any data type, however the key can only be of a type that is immutable (int, float, string, Boolean).
